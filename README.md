# LocalAi-Assistant (WIP)

This is a simplistic UI for a LocalAi (https://github.com/mudler/LocalAI) server (Also supports OpenAi) built using Maui.
It is very much a WIP, It is never expected to be perfect.
More features are planned but are yet to be completed.
This is done in free time so updates may be sparse.
I am also self taught and not very "gitty" so ignore the noob mistakes.

# Current Features:
Text Generation, 
Image Generation, 
Video Generation (Untested), 
Audio Generation

Microsoft Store: https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9p6r6bqpsnn7?hl=en-us&gl=US  || Google Play: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.TwinLunarStarZ.LocalAiAssistant

# Build:
Copy the "LocalAiAssistant.csproj" file into the "LocalAiAssistant" folder.
Load the "LocalAiAssistant.sln" using Visual Studio or other compatible software(I used Visual Studio 2022).
Build/run.
